Suppose Ashley's character, a wizard named Saruman, is trying to cast a spell that will allow him to control his opponent. Ashley rolls a 20-sided die, adds a modifier of 11 to the result (because her character is good at casting spells), and succeeds in casting the spell if the total is at least 17.\n",

It should take one argument, a DataFrame `df` with a single column column called `'serial_number'` (like `observations`).  It should plot a histogram of the values in the `'serial_number'` column **using bins of width 1** ranging from **1 to 200 (inclusive)** but return nothing.  Then, call that function to make a histogram of `observations`."

    "Since resampling from a large random sample looks just like sampling from a population, the code should look almost the same, too. That means we can write a function that simulates either sampling from a population or resampling from a sample.  If we pass it a population as its argument, it will do the former; if we pass it a sample, it will do the latter.\n",

    "- `original_df`: A DataFrame from which the data should be sampled, with a single column named `'serial_number'`.\n",
    "- `sample_size`: The size of each sample, an integer. (For example, to do resampling, we would pass the number of rows in `original_df` for this argument.)\n",
    "- `statistic`: A **function** that computes a statistic on a sample. This argument is the **name of a function** that takes a Series of serial numbers as its argument and returns a number (e.g. `calculate_mean_based_estimate`).\n",
    "- `repetitions`: The number of repetitions to perform (i.e. the number of resamples to create).\n",
    "\n",
    "It should simulate `repetitions` samples **with replacement** from the given DataFrame. For each of those samples, it should compute the statistic on that sample. Then it should return an array containing the value of that statistic for each sample (this means that the length of the returned array should be equal to `repetitions`).\n",
