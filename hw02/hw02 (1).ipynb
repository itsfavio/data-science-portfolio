    "Welcome to Homework 2! This week, we will cover DataFrame manipulations, making visualizations, and defining functions. You can find additional help on these topics in  [BPD 6, 9-12](https://notes.dsc10.com/01-getting_started/functions-defining.html) in the `babypandas` notes and [CIT 7-7.3](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/07/Visualization.html) in the textbook."

    "Remember to start early and submit often. You are given six slip days throughout the quarter to extend deadlines. See the syllabus for more details. With the exception of using slip days, late work will not be accepted unless you have made special arrangements with your instructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: For homeworks, the `otter` tests don't usually tell you that your answer is correct. More often, they help catch careless mistakes. It's up to you to ensure that your answer is correct. If you're not sure, ask someone (not for the answer, but for some guidance about your approach). These are great questions for office hours (see the schedule on the [Calendar](https://dsc10.com/calendar)) or Ed. Directly sharing answers is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Please do not use for-loops for any questions in this homework.** If you don't know what a for-loop is, don't worry – we haven't covered them yet. But if you do know what they are and are wondering why it's not OK to use them, it is because loops in Python are slow, and looping over arrays and DataFrames should usually be avoided.\n",

    "<font color=red>**🚨 If you create a data visualization that is too cluttered to read or takes more than a few seconds to generate, this is a sign you are doing something wrong. Do not submit code like this, or the Gradescope autograder may fail to grade your entire assignment. It's better to leave a question blank than to submit code that will cause the autograder to fail on your full assignment.**</font>"

    "Your scatter plot shows how the event locations are related to one another geographically, but it's hard to draw much insight from such a basic plot. For example, you might not realize from looking at the plot above that all the dots in the upper left corner correspond to events happening on UCSD's campus, while the dots in the bottom right correspond to events happening in downtown San Diego. That would be much easier to discover if we could plot these points not just on a scatter plot, but on a map.\n",

Run the cell below to import the package `folium`, which supports maps, and to see the ArtPower events on a map we've created using the `'Latitude'` and `'Longitude'` values in `artpower`. You don't need to understand the code that creates the map, but do try zooming in and clicking around on the map that is produced. "
